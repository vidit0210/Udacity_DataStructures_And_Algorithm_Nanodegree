For loop to iter and check
Two variables to keep check min and max number in the array.
If lowest element encounters while traversing over the array the lowest is updated.
If largest element encounters while traversing over the array the lergest is updated.

Time Comlexity O(n) Linear
Space Complexity O(1) Constant
