Used Binary Search Algorithmn to come with a solution to find squared root.
if we hit between mid and mid +1 the mid is returned or the floor of the Number

Time Complexity is Logarithmic because We don't over the complete loop we work with middle index as our refrence and increase or decrease it accordingly.

Time Complexity : O(logn) Logarithmic
Space Complexity : O(1) Constant
