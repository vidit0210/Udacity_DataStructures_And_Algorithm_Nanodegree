Not allowed to use any Cutsom Sort Function.I Have implemented merge Sort the merge Sortr Algorithmn in descending order.

Merge Sort takes time Complexity of O(nlogn)
After Sorting the Array in descending order eg [9,8,7,6,5,4]
even and odd indexes are concatenated together done to get the answer 0 1 2 3 4 5
This Will give us 975 and 864 as answer

Time Complexity : O(nlogn)
Space Complexity : O(n)
